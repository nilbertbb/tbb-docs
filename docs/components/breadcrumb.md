# Breadcrumb

The Breadcrumb component helps users understand their current location in the site hierarchy and navigate back to previous levels.

## 🧩 Usage

_TODO: Document how to enable breadcrumbs in AEM and how it pulls data from page properties._

## 🔗 Example Structure

- Home / Category / Subcategory / Page

## ⚙️ Page Properties

- `navigationTitle`
- `hideInBreadcrumb`

These properties influence how pages appear in the breadcrumb trail.

## 💡 Best Practices

- Keep it concise: 3–5 levels is ideal
- Always show the root (e.g., “Home”)
- Use consistent naming across the site tree

## 🛠️ Technical Notes

_TODO: Mention selectors, DOM structure, and accessibility notes._
