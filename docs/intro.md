# Welcome to TBB Docs

This is the internal documentation hub for the TBB team, focused primarily on **AEM development workflows**, component structure, project setup, and shared standards.

Our goal is to centralize the knowledge required to work effectively across projects — especially where AEM introduces complexity or recurring challenges.

---

## 📚 What you'll find here

- 🚀 Step-by-step guides for project setup and lifecycle
- 🧩 Documentation for AEM components and Experience Fragments
- 🎨 Styling conventions using CSS/SASS
- ✅ Pull Request and QA processes
- 🧠 Performance guidelines (Lighthouse, RUM, etc.)
- ⚙️ Page-level settings and configuration behaviors

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This documentation was created to:

- Standardize how we start and scale projects in AEM
- Clarify how each component behaves and integrates
- Reduce bugs and improve consistency across teams
- Support onboarding for new developers and cross-team collaboration

---

## 🤝 How to contribute

If you notice something missing, outdated, or unclear:

- Submit a Pull Request with your edits
- Or leave a note for the team to review

Together, we maintain a better workflow.
