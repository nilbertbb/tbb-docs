# RUM (Real User Monitoring)

RUM provides insights based on actual user interaction with the site. This complements lab-based tools like Lighthouse by showing real-world performance.

## 🔍 What It Tracks

- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Device/browser segmentation

## 🎯 Tools Used

- Akamai RUM
- Web Vitals scripts
- Google Analytics (custom events)

## 📈 Benefits

- Monitors real users instead of simulations
- Helps detect regional performance issues
- Guides infrastructure or frontend optimizations

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

_TODO: Add details about how RUM is configured in TBB projects._
